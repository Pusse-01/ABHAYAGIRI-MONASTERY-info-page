Many ancient sources testify that a large number of monks lived in the Abhayagiri monastery for learning Buddhism and meditation. Here special attention will be paid to the rooms used for the accommodation of the monks and the toilets and latrine used for sanitation. This is because of the curiosity that arises from the way in which such a large number of monks have been able to meet the day to day needs of their meditation and learning activities in the past with such poor technology. And also a curiosity was arises about how the sanitary facilities are provided  for pilgrims in ancient times. . Therefore, archaeologists are still struggling to gather enough evidence before reaching the final conclusion about whereabouts and the people who use those lavatories(monks or pilgrims) and the technology that they have use to build those lavatories(disposal of waste).
