â€¢	Archaeologists have unearthed a stone lavatory complex with intricate carvings during excavations near the north gate outside the abhayagiri stupa. It is suspected that the lavatory system belongs to the late Anuradhapura period. It is believed that this lavatory complex , which is located just outside the north entrance of the stupa, was built for the use of pilgrims and not for monks.
