Abhayagiri was one of the Buddhist teaching center in Asia, where large number of Buddhist monks learned the teaching of Buddha. The monks from all around the world had been gathering in there. It is believed that Abhayagiri monastery was a place where large number of scholarly monks lived as it was a major seat of learning. The ruins of various types of buildings with various carvings and arts made of gold, silver and gems give us a better understanding of the pride of the past. In those times there had been as much as 5000 monks in Abhayagiri. Monk Fa-hsien lived in this monastery aa for 2 years and learnt Buddhism from scholar monks. According to monk Fa-hsien “Anuradhapura city is the residence of magistrate, grandees and many foreign merchants; the mansions beautiful and public buildings richly adorned, the streets and highway straight and level and houses for preaching built at every thoroughfare.”
